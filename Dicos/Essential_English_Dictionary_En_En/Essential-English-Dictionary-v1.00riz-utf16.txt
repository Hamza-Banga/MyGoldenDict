Essential English Dictionary 1.00riz is based on Wordnet 3.0, which I saw in Lingoes dictionary program. Wordnet 3.0 gives added information of synonyms, hypernyms, which makes the dictionary output cluttered. So, I realized that removing the extra thesaurus elements from wordnet makes it a good dictionary which gives precise meanings without cluttering the dictionary (goldendict) interface/page.
